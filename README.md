## Analysis of Airbnb listing data for Berlin


### Project Motivation

In the following project I am analyzing data of Airbnb listings for the city of Berlin for the period of 07/2019 - 07/2020.
The data was downloaded from the [insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) website.

The goal of this notebook is to clean, transform and visualize the data in order to answer the three following questions:

1. Looking at the prices for Airbnb listings for Berlin, do prices differ among the Berlin neighborhoods? Do some neighborhoods have more expensive or cheaper Airbnb listings than others?

2. Do visitor numbers and listing prices fluctuate over the year?

3. How do Airbnb prices in Berlin compare to another large german city, Munich?

This project was done as an assignment for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.


### Installation

An Anaconda distribution with Python 3 is sufficient to run this code.
